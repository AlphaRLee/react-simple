# React from scratch
2021-02-06
A simplified react without bloat

## Usage
Go to the parent folder of the planned project then type:
```
react-simple <your_project_here>
```
Note: If the command `react-simple` is not recognized, `cd` into this project folder and type `npm link`. Then go back to the parent folder and try again.

## About
Using create-react-app loads a lot of dependencies I don't use.
This project follows [this tutorial](https://dev.to/nikhilkumaran/don-t-use-create-react-app-how-you-can-set-up-your-own-reactjs-boilerplate-43l0) to create a React app with minimal dependencies.
